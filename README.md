## Installation

### Update your Camera
1. Format an SD Card as FAT32. It's recommended to format the card in the camera using the camera's native format function.
2. Copy the contents of sdhack/ to the root of the SD Card
3. Download the latest release from [the Releases page](https://github.com/roleoroleo/yi-hack-Allwinner/releases)
4. Copy `home_y20gam` to the root of the SD Card.
5. Rename `home_y20gam` to `home_y20gam.stage`
6. Insert the SD Card and reboot the camera
7. Wait for the camera to update. It will reboot a couple of times as the camera is rooted and the new firmware is applied. It will take a few minutes to update. Once the light is solid blue for at least a minute it is complete.
